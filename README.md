# pokemon-prison-break
An old game with a new twist

Some nasty 'ol meanie has been capturing Pokémon and keeping them locked up in cells.
To save a Pokémon you need to figure out the secret passcode that unlocks the cell.
You will know how many letters the passcode is, but regardless, guess six wrong letters and the alarm goes off and neither the Pokémon nor you escape.
Once you open the cell you will have the chance to befriend the imprisoned Pokémon.
To become their friend you simply need to know their species name, and similar to the door locking mechanism, guess six wrong letters in their species name and they will thank you for freeing them but rebuff your friendship.
How many can you save? How many new friends will you make in the process? Just don't get caught!
Each wing has 4 cells, and after opening all four, those Pokémon successfully escape even if you get caught in the next wing.
