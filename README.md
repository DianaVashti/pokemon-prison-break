# pokemon-prison-break
An old game with a new twist

Some nasty 'ol meanie has been capturing PokÃ©mon and keeping them locked up in cells.
To save a PokÃ©mon you need to figure out the secret passcode that unlocks the cell.
You will know how many letters the passcode is, but regardless, guess six wrong letters and the alarm goes off and neither the PokÃ©mon nor you escape.
Once you open the cell you will have the chance to befriend the imprisoned PokÃ©mon.
To become their friend you simply need to guess their species name, and similar to the door locking mechanism, guess six wrong letters in their species name and they will thank you for freeing them but rebuff your friendship.
How many can you save? How many new friends will you make in the process? Just don't get caught!

### Instructions
- The rules to the game are shown on the app landing page ðŸ˜Ž
- If you want to cheat and know the words, they are always logged to the browser console ðŸ˜‰

### Description
This is a single-page react web-application. The application uses a very basic and minimal server and otherwise handles all data and state management using the axios library to make AJAX calls from the front-end. The stack is: NODE/REACT/EXPRESS. Calls to the pokedex API are made using axios, while calls to the words API are routed through Express to deal with CORS restrictions. All of the non-configuration source code in within the `/src` folder where the server is located at `/src/app.js` and the components all are within the `src/views` folder. Right now there is only one main component (`LandingPage`). The app is responsive to a degree though improvements could be made to the accessibility of the mobile view and when making a browser window smaller. Who knew hangman could be so much fun when making PokÃ©mon friends is on the line.


### Things I want to do to this App next:
- WRITE TESTS!!! (Learn Selenium, and test front end. Use Mocha/Chai to test routes and data from the server.)
- Reactor to make more & smaller components and remove un-used modules.
- Make the difficulty settings dynamic and configurable by the player.
- Address react and material-ui errors that do not seem to affect the app currently but are still worrisome.
- Make a `hint` feature that either automatically kicks in when the player is on their last guess, or is a selectable event by the user.
- Improve design and feedback to user on success / fail / win / loss.
- Make the amount of pokemon that could be chosen dynamic so not all 803 forms are options for casual fans who may only know the big names or original 151 (including 'Mew').

*There are the files that need to be changed to have extension `.js`:
  - /webpack.config.txt
  - /src/app.txt
  - /src/main.txt
  - /src/reactRouter.txt
  - /src/view/LandingPage/LandingPage.txt
  - /src/view/LandingPage/PokeView.txt
